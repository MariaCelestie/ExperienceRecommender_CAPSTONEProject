# ExperienceRecommender_CAPSTONEProject

In this project, we aim to build a web application that is capable of recommending customized work experience portfolio. This is implemented by mining data from various public job portals and then using machine learning algorithms to personalize this data for the specific job role. This application is then hosted on AWS following the devops practices. Agile method will be used throughout the project lifecycle.

The entire workflow of this project will be based on agile methodology and managed using Jira. The application will be deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.The infrastructure automation on the Cloud is provisioned by Terraform. We will be using GitLab CI/CD pipelines. And to run jobs in this pipeline, we use GitLab Runner. DevOps tools such as Ansible and Jenkins may be used based on requirement. For the application development, Python frameworks like Django or Flask will be used. The model combines NLP techniques and classification style machine learning algorithms in order to determine the best fit for a user.
